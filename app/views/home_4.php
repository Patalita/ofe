    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
    The rapid growth of online learning has mandated the development of faculty evaluation models geared specifically toward the unique demands of the online classroom. With a foundation in the best practices of online learning, adapted to meet the dynamics of a growing online program, the Online Instructor Evaluation System created at Park University serves the dual purpose of mentoring and faculty evaluation. As such, the model contains two distinct phases of interaction: formative reviews and a summative evaluation. Beyond its critical role in instructor retention, program assessment, and accreditation, this faculty evaluation system signals the University's commitment to ongoing professional development. The Online Instructor Evaluation System maximizes the potential of faculty evaluation to inspire reflection and growth; encourages the persistent professional development needs of online instructors; emphasizes the process of teaching as well as product; incorporates multiple perspectives to capture a comprehensive view of instructor performance; and educates key on-ground university constituents about online learning.

    In the infancy of online instruction, considerable emphasis was given to demonstrating equivalence between online and traditional face-to-face instruction. This movement extended from pedagogy to evaluation as many online programs mirrored established face-to-face processes for faculty evaluation when creating models for the virtual classroom. With the rapid growth of online learning, these early evaluation models have revealed limited relevance to the online environment both in content and implementation. To address the ineffectiveness of traditional faculty evaluation models for use with online faculty, as well as to contribute to the growth of online learning as a field (and not simply a practice), innovative faculty evaluation models that are geared specifically to the unique demands, expectations and requirements of modern online learning must be developed.
    </p>
    <h3>Institutional Context</h3>
    <p>
    The evaluation model for online faculty at Park University was created to meet the unique demands of an evolving online program. While Park University was founded as a small, private liberal-arts college in 1875, the original campus has grown to include graduate programs, 42 nation-wide campus centers, and an extensive online program supporting 45,000 annual student enrollments in seven online degree-completion programs and four fully-online graduate programs. Park University 's culture is as a teaching-oriented institution, with emerging expectations for faculty scholarship, research, and service. The institutional complexity at Park University samples challenges found across a host of institutions targeting 2- or 4-year degrees, public or private settings, and traditional or adult student populations. As such, the University's online faculty evaluation model is potentially translatable to an equally wide range of higher-learning institutions. With the increasing popularity and growth of online learning, it is essential to establish clear, direct, relevant guidelines for evaluating online faculty that maintain instructional quality and promote best practices in online education.
    </p>
    <h3>Rationale for Online Faculty Evaluation System</h3>
    <p>
    The legacy online faculty evaluation system at Park University was inadequate for evaluating the unique expectations and demands faced by online instructors within this system. Prior to the development of the new online evaluation system, online instructors were evaluated using a generic instrument designed for face-to-face distance instructors at the University's campus centers across the country. Because the evaluation was based on traditional classroom concerns, the instrument's evaluative criteria did not emphasize key competencies for effective online instruction, such as instructor response rate and availability; frequency and quality of presence in online classroom; facilitation of discussions in writing; usability of instructor-created supplemental content; and overall management of the administrative aspects of the course (approving final examination proctors, connecting students to University support resources, completing required administrative tasks, etc.).
    </p>
	<p>
    Also in keeping with traditional face-to-face evaluation models, the evaluator completed his/her review at the end of the term in a singular exchange with the instructor. While this type of singular formal interaction may be effective in the more intimate environment of the on-ground campus, where evaluators have ongoing opportunities to interact informally with instructors based on proximity, this practice does not translate meaningfully to the virtual classroom. In the online environment, the evaluation process often proved the first and only time the instructor and evaluator interacted. The limitations of this model were compounded by the fact that many online instructors were relatively new to the virtual classroom. Not only were the evaluation and recommendations for these instructors' online teaching practice being provided after the point at which suggestions could be effectively implemented into the classroom, the legacy evaluation instrument did not account for the limited online teaching experience of many of the University's online instructors. Thus, the assumptions under girding face-to-face faculty evaluation models limited the effectiveness of an online evaluation system based on traditional models.
    </p>
	<p>
    In addition to the flaws in the timing and content of the legacy evaluation system, there were growing concerns about the lack of peer support and professional guidance for instructors working within a geographically diverse and highly individualized environment. Larger University concerns present included the need to educate the key departmental leaders who were expected to work with online learning staff to evaluate online instructors. The legacy evaluation system did not provide these individuals, only some of whom had experience with online instruction, with the context and education needed to understand the differences between online and face-to-face methods. As such, the Online Instructor Evaluation System (OIES) was developed to reinforce key competencies and expectations unique to online faculty; provide significant professional development exchanges and resources for online faculty; and ensure a high-quality learning experience in all virtual classrooms. Moving outward, a tertiary goal of the OIES was to educate the broader University community about benchmarks and best practices of online learning to promote reciprocal exchange between online and face-to-face practitioners and practices.
